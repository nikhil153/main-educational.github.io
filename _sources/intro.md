The educational workshop is organized by the [UNIQUE](https://www.unique.quebec/) NeuroAI center as part of the Montreal Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience (MAIN) 2024 [conference](https://www.main2024.org/). This is an in person event.

The morning includes two parallel tracks with neuroAI primers on machine learning and neuroimaging. The afternoon features parallel sessions on two foundational techniques for neuroAI: brain decoding and representational similarity analysis. Finally, two keynote tutorials will introduce recent and exciting neuroAI applications: in-silico neuroimaging experiments and foundation models for modelling movement.

You will be required to bring a laptop and install software prior to the workshop. Coffee, snack and lunch will be offered onsite.
